2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

specifics about this infrastructure:
•	For every additional element, why are adding it: we have added three new
components; a firewall for each server to protect them from being attacked and exploited,
1 SSL certificate to server www.foobar.com over HTTPS and three monitoring clients
that will collect logs and send them to  data collector .
•	What are firewalls for: to monitor and control incoming
and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It 
establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.
•	Why is the traffic served over HTTPS: because HTTPS is secure where the data is encrypted using Transfer Layer Security (TLS).
•	What monitoring is used for: it provides the capability to detect and diagnose any web
application performance issues proactively.
•	How the monitoring tool is collecting data: it collects logs of the application server,
MySQL Database and Nginx web server. A log in a computing context is the
automatically produced and time-stamped documentation of events relevant to a
particular system.
•	Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS: one web server
handles 1K queries per second (QPS), I would basically monitor it from the network and
application level.

Issues are with this infrastructure:
•	Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue: it is an issue because
decryption is resource and CPU intensive. Placing the decryption burden on the load
balancer enables the server to spend processing power on application tasks.
•	Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
because once it is down it means data can be added or updated meaning some
features of the application won’t work.
•	Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and
application server) might be a problem: because once you have a bug in one of
the components in one of the servers then the bug will be valid in the other servers.
