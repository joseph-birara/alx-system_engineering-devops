3. Scale up

specifics about this infrastructure:
â€¢	For every additional element, why are adding it; we have added one server and one
load balancer. Adding the new server allowed us to separate each component in there own server
and yet having one extra server with all the components to serve as a backup if any of
the components or server fails. Each server is being monitored and has a firewall. We
have also added an extra load balancer to handle more traffic across the
whole infrastructure.
